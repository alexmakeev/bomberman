# UnifiedGameServerImpl Module

## Overview
The UnifiedGameServerImpl module serves as the central orchestration layer for the entire Bomberman multiplayer game server. It integrates all specialized handlers (game events, notifications, user actions) through a unified event system and manages the complete server lifecycle from WebSocket connections to game room coordination.

## Role in Project
This module is the main server controller that coordinates all game operations:
- **Server Orchestration**: Manages startup, shutdown, and runtime coordination
- **Connection Management**: WebSocket connection lifecycle and player session handling
- **Room & Game Management**: Creates rooms, starts games, manages player matchmaking
- **Event System Integration**: Unifies all handlers through centralized event bus
- **Configuration Management**: Server settings, environment configuration, runtime parameters
- **Health Monitoring**: Server status, performance metrics, system health checks

## Key Features
- **Unified Architecture**: Single entry point integrating all specialized handlers
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time bidirectional communication with game clients
- **Room-based Multiplayer**: Isolated game sessions with custom settings
- **Event-driven Design**: All operations flow through centralized event system
- **Graceful Lifecycle**: Proper startup/shutdown with resource cleanup
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive status reporting and diagnostics
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment-based settings and runtime adaptation

## System Components Managed
- **EventBus**: Central event distribution system
- **GameEventHandler**: Real-time game mechanics processing
- **UserNotificationHandler**: Multi-channel player notifications  
- **UserActionHandler**: Behavioral analytics and tracking
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time client communication
- **Room Manager**: Game session orchestration
- **Connection Pool**: Player session management

## Interface Implementation
Implements: `src/interfaces/core/UnifiedGameServer.d.ts`

## Dependencies
- **All Specialized Handlers**: GameEventHandler, UserNotificationHandler, UserActionHandler
- **EventBus**: Core event system
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication layer
- **Configuration**: Server settings and environment variables

## Usage Examples
```typescript
// Server lifecycle
const server = await createConfiguredUnifiedGameServer();
await server.start();

// Connection handling
await server.handleConnection({
  connectionId: 'conn_123',
  socket: websocket,
  ipAddress: '127.0.0.1',
  connectedAt: new Date()
});

// Room management
const room = await server.createRoom(hostPlayerId, {
  maxPlayers: 4,
  isPrivate: false,
  gameMode: 'cooperative'
});

// Game lifecycle
const game = await server.startGame(room.roomId);

// Event publishing
await server.publishEvent({
  category: 'GAME_EVENT',
  type: 'PLAYER_JOINED',
  data: { playerId, roomId }
});

// Server monitoring
const status = server.getStatus();
```

## Server Status Monitoring
- **Runtime Status**: uptime, active connections, memory usage
- **Game Statistics**: active rooms, games in progress, player count
- **Handler Health**: EventBus, GameEventHandler, NotificationHandler status
- **Performance Metrics**: event throughput, response times, error rates
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network utilization

## Configuration Management
- **Server Settings**: port, connection limits, timeouts, compression
- **Event System**: TTL, retry policies, monitoring thresholds
- **Database Connections**: PostgreSQL and Redis configuration
- **Security Settings**: CORS, rate limiting, authentication
- **Environment Adaptation**: development vs production optimizations

## Deployment Features
- **Docker Integration**: Container-ready with health checks
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper WebSocket cleanup and state persistence
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic restart capabilities and state restoration
- **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling support with session affinity
- **Monitoring Hooks**: Metrics export for external monitoring systems

## Performance Specifications
- **Concurrent Connections**: 1000+ WebSocket connections
- **Room Capacity**: 100+ concurrent game rooms
- **Players per Room**: Up to 8 players per Bomberman game
- **Event Throughput**: 10,000+ events/second across all handlers
- **Response Times**: <50ms for game actions, <200ms for room operations

## Security Features
- **Connection Validation**: IP-based filtering and rate limiting
- **Input Sanitization**: All WebSocket message validation
- **Authentication Integration**: Player session verification
- **Anti-cheat Integration**: Action validation and anomaly detection
- **Resource Protection**: Memory and CPU usage monitoring
