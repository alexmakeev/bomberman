# GameEventHandlerImpl Module

## Overview
The GameEventHandlerImpl module manages all real-time game events in the Bomberman multiplayer experience. It processes player actions, game state changes, and coordinates game mechanics with optimized performance for low-latency gameplay.

## Role in Project
This module is the heart of the game logic system, responsible for:
- **Player Action Processing**: Movement, bomb placement, power-up collection
- **Game Mechanics**: Bomb explosions, collision detection, player elimination
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time game state updates across all players
- **Event Broadcasting**: Distributing game events to connected clients
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient processing for smooth multiplayer experience

## Key Features
- **Real-time Event Processing**: Sub-100ms latency for player actions
- **Game State Management**: Centralized game state with atomic updates
- **Collision Detection**: Player-bomb-wall interaction handling
- **Bomb Mechanics**: Placement validation, explosion timing, damage calculation
- **Power-up System**: Collection, effect application, spawn management
- **Player Elimination**: Death detection, respawn coordination
- **Event Validation**: Security checks for all incoming game actions

## Game Mechanics Handled
- **Player Movement**: Position validation, collision checking, boundary enforcement
- **Bomb System**: Placement rules, timer management, explosion patterns
- **Destructible Environment**: Wall destruction, maze modification
- **Power-ups**: Speed boost, bomb capacity, blast radius enhancement
- **Cooperative Gameplay**: Friendly fire detection, team coordination
- **Monster Interactions**: AI enemy behavior, player-monster combat

## Interface Implementation
Implements: `src/interfaces/specialized/GameEventHandler.d.ts`

## Dependencies
- **EventBus**: Core event distribution system
- **Game Types**: `src/types/game.d.ts` - Game state structures
- **Common Types**: `src/types/common.d.ts` - Entity definitions

## Usage Examples
```typescript
// Player actions
await gameEvents.handlePlayerAction(gameId, playerId, moveAction);
await gameEvents.handleBombPlacement(gameId, playerId, position);

// Game mechanics
await gameEvents.handleBombExplosion(gameId, bombId);
await gameEvents.handlePowerUpCollection(gameId, playerId, powerUpId);

// State queries
const gameState = await gameEvents.getGameState(gameId);
```

## Performance Specifications
- Action processing: <50ms per event
- State synchronization: 60 FPS updates
- Concurrent players: Up to 8 per game
- Event throughput: 1000+ events/second
- Memory usage: <512MB per active game

## Security Features
- Input validation for all player actions
- Anti-cheat position validation
- Rate limiting for action frequency
- Sanitized event broadcasting
