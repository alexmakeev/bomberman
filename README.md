# Bomberman: Cooperative Multiplayer Game

A modern web-based implementation of the classic Bomberman game, reimagined for **cooperative multiplayer gameplay** where friends work together to complete objectives while avoiding friendly fire.

## üéÆ Game Concept

### Core Vision
Transform the traditional competitive Bomberman experience into a **cooperative team-based adventure** where players must collaborate to overcome challenges, defeat AI enemies, and achieve shared objectives.

### Key Features

#### **Cooperative Gameplay** ü§ù
- **Team-focused mechanics**: Players work together rather than against each other
- **Friendly fire warnings**: System discourages accidental teammate damage
- **Shared objectives**: Victory requires team coordination and cooperation
- **10-second respawn system**: Eliminated players rejoin quickly to maintain team momentum

#### **Dynamic Objectives** üéØ
- **Boss Battles**: Coordinate attacks to defeat powerful AI bosses with multiple phases
- **Exit Gate Discovery**: Systematically explore maze to find hidden exit gates
- **Gate Destruction Consequences**: Accidentally destroying gates spawns monster waves
- **Escalating Difficulty**: Each destroyed gate increases monster power and spawn rates
- **Survival Mode**: If all gates are destroyed, objectives shift to endless survival

#### **Real-time Multiplayer** üåê
- **WebSocket-based communication**: Low-latency real-time synchronization
- **Room-based sessions**: Create shareable rooms for friends to join
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Play on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Reconnection support**: Automatic reconnection with state recovery

#### **Mobile-First Design** üì±
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Install as native app on mobile devices
- **Touch controls**: Virtual joystick and haptic feedback for mobile
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Offline capabilities**: Practice mode available without internet connection

#### **Strategic Gameplay Elements** ‚ö°
- **Power-up system**: Enhance bomb capacity, blast radius, and special abilities
- **AI Monster variety**: Different enemy types with unique behaviors and tactics
- **Minimap navigation**: Strategic overview with fog of war mechanics
- **Environmental destruction**: Destructible mazes that change as you play

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### **Frontend (Client)**
- **Vue.js 3** with Composition API for reactive UI components
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development and better code maintainability
- **HTML5 Canvas** for high-performance 2D game rendering
- **PWA technologies** (Service Workers, Web App Manifest) for native app experience
- **WebSocket client** integrated with unified EventBus system

#### **Backend (Server)**
- **Node.js** with **Koa.js** framework for lightweight, fast server
- **TypeScript** for consistent full-stack type safety
- **Unified EventBus** architecture for maximum code reuse across all event types
- **WebSocket server** with event-driven message routing
- **Specialized event handlers** for games, notifications, user actions, and admin events

#### **Infrastructure**
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment environments
- **Redis** for real-time event distribution and pub/sub messaging
- **PostgreSQL** for persistent game data, user statistics, and audit logs
- **Nginx** for load balancing and static asset serving
- **Dual-storage architecture** optimized for both real-time and persistent data
