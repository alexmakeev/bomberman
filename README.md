# Bomberman: Cooperative Multiplayer Game

A modern web-based implementation of the classic Bomberman game, reimagined for **cooperative multiplayer gameplay** where friends work together to complete objectives while avoiding friendly fire.

## üéÆ Game Concept

### Core Vision
Transform the traditional competitive Bomberman experience into a **cooperative team-based adventure** where players must collaborate to overcome challenges, defeat AI enemies, and achieve shared objectives.

### Key Features

#### **Cooperative Gameplay** ü§ù
- **Team-focused mechanics**: Players work together rather than against each other
- **Friendly fire warnings**: System discourages accidental teammate damage
- **Shared objectives**: Victory requires team coordination and cooperation
- **10-second respawn system**: Eliminated players rejoin quickly to maintain team momentum

#### **Dynamic Objectives** üéØ
- **Boss Battles**: Coordinate attacks to defeat powerful AI bosses with multiple phases
- **Exit Gate Discovery**: Systematically explore maze to find hidden exit gates
- **Gate Destruction Consequences**: Accidentally destroying gates spawns monster waves
- **Escalating Difficulty**: Each destroyed gate increases monster power and spawn rates
- **Survival Mode**: If all gates are destroyed, objectives shift to endless survival

#### **Real-time Multiplayer** üåê
- **WebSocket-based communication**: Low-latency real-time synchronization
- **Room-based sessions**: Create shareable rooms for friends to join
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Play on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Reconnection support**: Automatic reconnection with state recovery

#### **Mobile-First Design** üì±
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Install as native app on mobile devices
- **Touch controls**: Virtual joystick and haptic feedback for mobile
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Offline capabilities**: Practice mode available without internet connection

#### **Strategic Gameplay Elements** ‚ö°
- **Power-up system**: Enhance bomb capacity, blast radius, and special abilities
- **AI Monster variety**: Different enemy types with unique behaviors and tactics
- **Minimap navigation**: Strategic overview with fog of war mechanics
- **Environmental destruction**: Destructible mazes that change as you play

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

```

### Development Server Management

The project includes a **unified development server manager** that provides flexible control over frontend, backend, or both servers with proper dependency management.

#### üéØ Why Use the Unified Server Manager?

- **Flexible Mode Selection**: Choose frontend-only, backend-only, or full environment
- **Automatic Port Management**: Kills conflicting processes before starting
- **Background Operation**: Runs servers in background with proper process management  
- **Unified Status Monitoring**: Always shows status of both servers regardless of mode
- **Docker Integration**: Automatically starts required database services for backend
- **Clean Operations**: Proper stop/start sequence prevents port conflicts

#### üöÄ Server Management Commands

```bash
# Start servers (automatically stops existing processes first)
./scripts/start-dev.sh start front    # Frontend only - for UI development
./scripts/start-dev.sh start back     # Backend only - for API development  
./scripts/start-dev.sh start full     # Both servers - for full development

# Stop servers  
./scripts/start-dev.sh stop front     # Stop frontend only
./scripts/start-dev.sh stop back      # Stop backend only
./scripts/start-dev.sh stop full      # Stop both servers

# Check status (always shows both servers)
./scripts/start-dev.sh status         # Comprehensive status of all services
```

#### üìä Server Status Output

```bash
$ ./scripts/start-dev-full.sh status
üìä Development Environment Status
--------------------------------

üê≥ Docker Services:
NAME                     STATUS                    PORTS
bomberman-postgres       Up 10 hours (healthy)     0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
bomberman-redis          Up 10 hours (healthy)     0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp

üóÑÔ∏è  Backend Server (Port 8080):
üü¢ Server is running on port 8080
üìã Process details:
  PID  PPID CMD
 1234  5678 npm run dev:server
üåê URL: http://localhost:8080
‚úÖ Server is responding to requests

üñ•Ô∏è  Frontend Server (Port 3000):
üü¢ Server is running on port 3000
üìã Process details:
  PID  PPID CMD
 5678  9012 npm run dev:client
üåê URL: http://localhost:3000
‚úÖ Server is responding to requests
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Flexible Modes**: Use `front` for UI development, `back` for API work, `full` for complete development
- **Port Management**: Frontend runs on port 3000, Backend runs on port 8080
- **Database Dependencies**: Backend modes automatically start PostgreSQL and Redis via Docker
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Script always stops existing processes before starting new ones
- **Background Operation**: Servers run in background, use appropriate `stop` command to terminate
- **Unified Status**: Status command always shows both servers regardless of the mode used
- **Default Mode**: If no mode is specified, `full` is used as default

### UI Testing with Playwright

The project includes comprehensive UI testing using **Playwright with Docker browsers** to ensure cross-platform compatibility while keeping the development environment clean. Tests cover both basic UI functionality and full integration scenarios based on documented use cases.

#### üé≠ Test Architecture

- **Docker-based browsers**: All browsers run in containers to avoid polluting the host OS
- **Multi-browser testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (WebKit) on desktop and mobile
- **Visual regression**: Screenshots and videos captured for debugging
- **Headless by default**: Fast execution with visual feedback when needed
- **Use case driven**: Integration tests implement real user scenarios from sequence diagrams

#### üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Start development server (required)
npm run dev:client

# Run basic UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Run integration tests (use cases)
./scripts/test-integration.sh all

# Interactive mode (keeps containers running)
npm run test:ui:interactive
```

#### üìã Integration Testing

The project includes a dedicated integration test runner for comprehensive use case testing:

```bash
# Test specific use case categories
./scripts/test-integration.sh gamer     # UC-G001, UC-G002, UC-G003 (player flows)
./scripts/test-integration.sh admin     # UC-A001 (admin monitoring)  
./scripts/test-integration.sh system    # WebSocket/Redis integration flows
./scripts/test-integration.sh all       # All integration tests

# Advanced options
./scripts/test-integration.sh gamer --headed           # Run in headed mode
./scripts/test-integration.sh admin --debug            # Debug mode with pauses
./scripts/test-integration.sh system --reporter html   # HTML report output
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

Use the dedicated script for more control:

```bash
# Run specific browser
./scripts/test-playwright.sh --project "Desktop Chrome"
./scripts/test-playwright.sh --project "Mobile Safari"

# Run specific test file
./scripts/test-playwright.sh --project "Desktop Chrome" basic-ui.test.ts

# Run with debugging
./scripts/test-playwright.sh --debug --project "Desktop Chrome"

# Run all projects with custom settings
./scripts/test-playwright.sh --max-failures 5 --reporter html
```

4. **Run specific tests**: Isolate issues with `--project` and test file filters
5. **Integration test debugging**: Use `--debug` flag for step-by-step execution

```bash
# Debug a specific failing test
./scripts/test-playwright.sh --debug --project "Desktop Chrome" basic-ui.test.ts

# Debug specific integration test
./scripts/test-integration.sh gamer --debug --project "Desktop Chrome"

# View detailed HTML report

```

## üéØ Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### **Cooperative Elements**
- **Team Revival**: Dead players respawn automatically after 10 seconds
- **Shared Resources**: Power-ups benefit the entire team's strategy
- **Communication**: Visual cues and movement patterns for coordination
- **Joint Objectives**: All players must reach exit gate for victory

### **AI Challenge System**
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Monster strength scales with team performance
- **Behavioral Variety**: Different AI types require different strategies
- **Boss Encounters**: Multi-phase battles requiring team coordination
- **Wave Mechanics**: Gate destruction triggers escalating monster waves

### **Strategic Depth**
- **Risk vs Reward**: Destroying walls may reveal gates or spawn enemies
- **Resource Management**: Limited bombs require tactical placement
