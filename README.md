# Bomberman: Cooperative Multiplayer Game

A modern web-based implementation of the classic Bomberman game, reimagined for **cooperative multiplayer gameplay** where friends work together to complete objectives while avoiding friendly fire.

## üéÆ Game Concept

### Core Vision
Transform the traditional competitive Bomberman experience into a **cooperative team-based adventure** where players must collaborate to overcome challenges, defeat AI enemies, and achieve shared objectives.

### Key Features

#### **Cooperative Gameplay** ü§ù
- **Team-focused mechanics**: Players work together rather than against each other
- **Friendly fire warnings**: System discourages accidental teammate damage
- **Shared objectives**: Victory requires team coordination and cooperation
- **10-second respawn system**: Eliminated players rejoin quickly to maintain team momentum

#### **Dynamic Objectives** üéØ
- **Boss Battles**: Coordinate attacks to defeat powerful AI bosses with multiple phases
- **Exit Gate Discovery**: Systematically explore maze to find hidden exit gates
- **Gate Destruction Consequences**: Accidentally destroying gates spawns monster waves
- **Escalating Difficulty**: Each destroyed gate increases monster power and spawn rates
- **Survival Mode**: If all gates are destroyed, objectives shift to endless survival

#### **Real-time Multiplayer** üåê
- **WebSocket-based communication**: Low-latency real-time synchronization
- **Room-based sessions**: Create shareable rooms for friends to join
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Play on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Reconnection support**: Automatic reconnection with state recovery

#### **Mobile-First Design** üì±
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Install as native app on mobile devices
- **Touch controls**: Virtual joystick and haptic feedback for mobile
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Offline capabilities**: Practice mode available without internet connection

#### **Strategic Gameplay Elements** ‚ö°
- **Power-up system**: Enhance bomb capacity, blast radius, and special abilities
- **AI Monster variety**: Different enemy types with unique behaviors and tactics
- **Minimap navigation**: Strategic overview with fog of war mechanics
- **Environmental destruction**: Destructible mazes that change as you play

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### **Frontend (Client)**
- **Vue.js 3** with Composition API for reactive UI components
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development and better code maintainability
- **HTML5 Canvas** for high-performance 2D game rendering
- **PWA technologies** (Service Workers, Web App Manifest) for native app experience
- **WebSocket client** for real-time communication with game server

#### **Backend (Server)**
- **Node.js** with **Koa.js** framework for lightweight, fast server
- **TypeScript** for consistent full-stack type safety
- **WebSocket server** for real-time multiplayer communication
- **Vuex/Pinia** for centralized state management (shared between client/server)
- **Database integration** for persistent player data and statistics

#### **Infrastructure**
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment environments
- **Redis** for session management and real-time data caching
- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB** for persistent game data and user statistics
- **Nginx** for load balancing and static asset serving

```

### Core Modules

#### **Game Engine**
- **Physics simulation**: Collision detection, movement, explosion calculations
- **AI systems**: Monster behavior, pathfinding, boss mechanics
- **State management**: Authoritative server state with client prediction
- **Game logic**: Bomb timers, power-ups, victory conditions

#### **Multiplayer System**
- **Room management**: Create, join, and manage game sessions
- **Player synchronization**: Real-time position and action updates
- **Latency compensation**: Client-side prediction and server reconciliation
- **Connection handling**: Automatic reconnection and error recovery

#### **Progressive Web App**
- **Service Worker**: Asset caching and offline functionality
- **Installation prompts**: Native app installation experience
- **Background sync**: Offline data synchronization when connection restored
- **Push notifications**: Game invitations and updates

#### **Admin Dashboard**
- **Real-time monitoring**: Active games, player statistics, server performance
- **Content moderation**: Chat filtering, player management, room oversight
- **Analytics**: Usage patterns, performance metrics, player engagement
- **Configuration**: Game parameters, feature flags, system settings

## üéØ Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### **Cooperative Elements**
- **Team Revival**: Dead players respawn automatically after 10 seconds
- **Shared Resources**: Power-ups benefit the entire team's strategy
- **Communication**: Visual cues and movement patterns for coordination
- **Joint Objectives**: All players must reach exit gate for victory

### **AI Challenge System**
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Monster strength scales with team performance
- **Behavioral Variety**: Different AI types require different strategies
- **Boss Encounters**: Multi-phase battles requiring team coordination
- **Wave Mechanics**: Gate destruction triggers escalating monster waves

### **Strategic Depth**
- **Risk vs Reward**: Destroying walls may reveal gates or spawn enemies
- **Resource Management**: Limited bombs require tactical placement
- **Map Knowledge**: Learning maze layouts and optimal paths
- **Team Composition**: Different players can specialize in different roles

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Input validation**: All player actions validated server-side
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents spam and abuse
- **Secure communication**: WSS (WebSocket Secure) for encrypted data
